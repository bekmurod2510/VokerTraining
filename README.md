# Invoker Trainer 🎮

Invoker Trainer is a simple web-based game designed to help players learn and memorize Invoker’s spell combinations through fast, repetitive practice.

The goal is to build muscle memory for the **Q / W / E** orb system in a fun, reaction-based format.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- Spells fall from the top of the screen one at a time
- Each spell corresponds to a specific **Q / W / E** combination
- The player presses the correct keys before the spell reaches the bottom
- Correct input → **score increases**
- Incorrect or late input → **no score**, next spell continues

The game tracks inputs in real time and gives immediate feedback.
